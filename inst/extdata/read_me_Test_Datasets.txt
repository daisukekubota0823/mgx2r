##### Data description

Data in full folder:
These data were generated by Marion Louveaux during her PhD thesis done at the ENS de Lyon between 2012 and 2015 under the supervision of Olivier Hamant. Meshes generated in MorphoGraphX (http://www.mpipz.mpg.de/MorphoGraphX) from the segmentation of a growing shoot apical meristem of Arabidopsis thaliana carrying a fluorescent membrane marker. Meristem was dissected and cut from the main stem of the plant, put in in vitro media and imaged over 48h every 12h with a confocal microscope. Cell graphs contain data relative to the area of the cells and local curvature of the tissue (computed with a radius of 10 microns).


Data in cropped folder:
Only part of the cells and the three first timepoints from the full datasets. Created from the original data (in full) by deletion of vertices outside an area covering part of the meristem, a boundary and part of an organ.




##### Data generation
For both full and cropped data.
Mesh .ply and cell graph .ply were saved in MorphoGraphX following the instructions below:
Process -> Mesh -> Cell Mesh -> Convert to 2D cell tissue

Process -> Mesh -> Heatmap -> Heatmap then select geometry and area. This computes the area heatmap.
Process -> Mesh -> Heatmap -> Heatmap Export to Attr Map with custom name "Geometry/Area". This exports the calculated areas to the attributes.
Process -> Mesh -> Cell Axis -> Curvature -> Compute Tissue Curvature (with default parameters e.g. radius to 10 microns) This computes the curvature of the tissue.
Process -> Mesh -> Cell Axis -> Cell Axis Export to Attr Map with custom name "Cell axis curv10microns". This exports the calculated curvatures to the attributes.

Process -> Mesh -> Save Cell Graph Ply file saves both mesh .ply and cell graph .ply to the disk.
