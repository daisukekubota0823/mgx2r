Hi Marion,

Attached are two ply files to give you an idea of the direction it is heading.

The first is the standard ply file of MGX, the second one is the new file with the information of the cell graph. Many values are simply set to 0 and I have left out the tensors for now to keep it simpler. Apart from that it is according to our specification we discussed in the last meeting.

What was your plan with the new format? Do you plan to write import/export procedures for R?

Cheers,
Soeren
